NVIDIA-labs OO Agents (NOOA) is a model-agnostic Python framework designed to support reliable AI agent development. Many agent frameworks represent prompts, tools, callbacks, and workflows as separate abstractions. NOOA offers an alternative object-oriented interface that brings these concepts together in a Python class. NOOA lets developers express an agent’s state, capabilities, prompts, and typed interfaces through a single Python class:

```python
from nooa import Agent

# The agent is a Python object.
class SupportAgent(Agent):
    """You are a support agent."""

    # State lives on the object. Fields are typed.
    order_db: OrderDB

    # Ordinary method. Just Python.
    def is_refund_eligible(self, order: Order) -> bool:
        return order.delivered and order.days_since_delivery <= 30

    # Agentic method: the runtime hands this to an LLM.
    async def triage(self, message: str, order: Order) -> Ticket:
        """Create a typed support ticket."""
        ...
```

**What's happening here:**

- **Agents are Python objects.** Fields are state, methods are capabilities, docstrings are prompts, type annotations are contracts.
- **`...` bodies are LLM-driven.** A method with `...` becomes an agentic loop; a real body stays deterministic Python. 
- **Code as action.** The model acts by writing Python in a Jupyter-style REPL with access to `self`, imports, and helpers — Python methods and type annotations supply the callable interfaces, reducing the need to write separate tool-schema definitions.
- **Pythonic and agent-ready.** Typed I/O with auto-retry, live-object arguments passed by reference, and model-callable context and event APIs — designed around agent-oriented Python workflows.

This design supports familiar Python testing, tracing, refactoring, and version-control workflows — **just like the rest of your software**. Read the paper for the design principles and evaluation results: [NVIDIA OO Agents: Native Python Object-Oriented Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.20709).

## Security Review Slice: Hardening Flow + Guard Labels

> Branch: `codex/security-hardening-e2e-provenance`

This optional joint branch composes the identity-approval hardening demo with the built-in `framework_guard_observer`. The demo still keeps backend receipts and findings outside core NOOA; the added proof is narrower: application-owned method effects and guard-shaped observer records can coexist in one event stream while retaining distinct `observer` labels.

| Review item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Adds | End-to-end identity-approval example plus a composition test over application `EffectRecord` telemetry, `framework_guard_observer()`, JSONL sink, run-scoped `SecurityReceipt`, and run-scoped `SecurityFinding` |
| Security claim | Applications can keep application-owned effects and guard-shaped records distinguishable by `observer` label while composing separately collected receipts and policy-specific findings. |
| Non-claim | The demo does not simulate an LLM attack, make same-process sinks/receipts trusted, authenticate the origin of a guard-shaped exception or record, turn guard telemetry into a vulnerability detector, or make NOOA enforce authorization policy. |
| Included slices | `codex/security-receipt-contract`, `codex/agent-call-effect-recorder`, `codex/effect-record-jsonl-sink`, `codex/security-finding-contract`, `codex/framework-guard-observer` |

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Add the **core** framework to a new (or existing) Python project:

```bash
uv init my-agent-project
cd my-agent-project

uv add "nooa @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@main"
```

<details>
<summary><b>Optional sub-packages</b> — CLI, memory, evaluation pipeline</summary>

<br />

All of these live in the same repo and are addressed with `#subdirectory=…`.

```bash
# CLI (beta): the `nooa` command, trace viewer, eval runner
uv add "nooa-cli @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@main#subdirectory=packages/nooa-cli"

# Long-term memory subsystem (MemoryManager)
uv add "nooa-memory @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@main#subdirectory=packages/nooa-memory"

# Evaluation pipeline for agent testing
uv add "eval_pipeline @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/labs-OO-Agents.git@main#subdirectory=util/eval_pipeline"
```

</details>

## Quick Start

## WARNING
This is a research tool that can be configured to execute LLM-generated code. LLM-generated code may take dangerous or unwanted actions, incuding sending private data to uncontrolled locations, deleting files, or modifying its environments.  Ensure you run NOOA agents in a sandboxed environment isolated from your primary filesystem, such as [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell).

> **Research software**  NOOA is research software, not production. We welcome contributions and fixes, but expect rough edges. 


### Choose a model

Choose from supported hosted or local [LiteLLM-supported](https://docs.litellm.ai/) model:

```python
from nooa.unifiedllm.registry import get_llm_client

llm = get_llm_client("claude-haiku-4-5")                                            # Anthropic (after `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`)
llm = get_llm_client("gpt-5-mini")                                                  # OpenAI    (after `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`)
llm = get_llm_client("ollama_chat/qwen3:1.7b", api_base="http://localhost:11434")   # Ollama    (no key)
llm = get_llm_client("hosted_vllm/Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B", api_base="http://localhost:8000/v1")  # vLLM (no key)
```

### Your first agent

***Agents are Python objects***. Methods with `...` bodies are **generation methods** — implemented at runtime by an LLM-driven strategy. The signature defines the contract; the docstring is the prompt.

```python
import asyncio

from nooa import Agent


class FeedbackAgent(Agent, llm=llm):
    """You are an agent specializing in analyzing customer feedback."""

    async def analyze_feedback(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Analyze customer feedback for sentiment and key topics in one sentence."""
        ...


async def main():
    agent = FeedbackAgent()
    result = await agent.analyze_feedback("Great product, but shipping was slow")
    print(result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the same code from your own project with `python`. You can run the checked-in example:

```bash
uv run python examples/quickstart/01_first_generation_method.py
```

Rename `analyze_feedback` to `analyze_feedback_briefly` and the output changes — your method name, parameters, and docstring *are* the prompt.

### See what your agent is doing

Every LLM call, code execution, and method invocation is traced by default — orchestrators, generation methods, and helpers, with parent-child spans preserved. If you installed the CLI and viewer dependencies, start the trace viewer and open the run in your browser:

```bash
uv run nooa start-dev        # trace viewer on http://localhost:5001
```

If the viewer isn't running, tracing is silently disabled — no configuration needed either way.
